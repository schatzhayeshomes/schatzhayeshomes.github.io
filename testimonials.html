            We are proud of the way we do business.  We work extraordinarily hard for our clients.  We like to think that we make them feel like we're family.  But don't take our word for it, see what they say themselves, and check out our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/SchatzHayesHomes">facebook</a> and Angie's list pages too!

              <h4>Sarah C.</h4>
              <p class="position">Purchased in Sterling, VA in 2011</p>
              <p>Andrea is a top notch professional and an exceptional real estate agent. Our grandmother became sick and needed to move from northern Virginia to Florida to be closer to her children, and Andrea was right there to help us put the house on the market and help our family prepare to move her. Andrea helped not only on the transactional side but also put our family in contact with good, trustworthy people to help us repair the home and prepare it for sale. She even lined up help moving and she and her husband even lent a hand. Andrea is truly a wonderful realtor and is a trustworthy, honest, good person to know, both professionally and personally.</p>

              <p class="position">First time home buyer in 2011</p>
              <p>Andrea is amazing in so many ways! I am a first-time home buyer, and if it weren't for Andrea, I'm sure I wouldn't be able to say that! She pays attention to all the details, knows how to "make the magic happen," and never gives up -- even when it seems impossible. She was always responsive to anything that needed attention, and stayed by my side through my "nervous ordeal" as I took this very giant step into home ownership! She didn't "disappear" after the sale, either, and to this day, has been available if I needed her as a resource. I highly recommend her (at every opportunity I get!) to anyone looking to buy and/or sell a home.</p>

              <p class="position">Home Inspector, Clingenpeel Properties Inc.</p>
              <p>As a Home Inspector, I watch and listen to a lot of real estate agents interact with our respective clients. I can tell which ones are just selling houses and which ones are truly representing their clients best interests. Andrea Shatz Hayes is a terrific and ferocious advocate when it comes to negotiating with the other party and protecting her clients position.</p>

              <h4>Sarah and Joe</h4>
              <p class="position">First time home buyer in 2012</p>
              <p>As first time home buyers, we didn't know where to start but Andrea answered all of our questions and provided us with several options. She was always available to answer questions regarding the purchase of our family's first home.  I can recall several occasions where she took the time to call us after working hours to reassure us that the process was going smoothly.  She was always patient and understanding when we needed clarification or support on any issue.  Our family is settled and thriving in our new home thanks to Andrea's help!</p>

              <p class="position">Purchasers in 2012</p>
              <p>Andrea has the unique ability of combining integrity professionalism with friendship and support.  Her attention to detail and her ability to not only get to know her clients but truly understand their needs is unparalleled.  It was a pleasure to work with someone so knowledgeable about the area, market, schools, etc... Even when we became difficult shoppers Andrea stayed patient and kept us focused on finding our dream home.  We appreciated working with a realtor who was truly interested in making sure we found exactly what we wanted, and wasn't just out to make a sale. Andrea was accessible whenever we needed her and even now (after we have purchased our home)  providing advice in others aspects of home ownership.   During the process of working with Andrea  we not only  gained a beautiful home but also a friend for life.</p>

              <p class="position">Purchasers in 2013</p>
              <p>She is wonderful.  She is knowledgeable, skillful, an excellent communicator and is simply fanatical about customer service.  We had a rather difficult time with the seller of the single family we purchased (with both the agent and the seller) and Andrea was professional and stuck to the facts.  She fairly and vigorously negotiated on our behalf and we could not be more pleased with both outcomes.
				<br /><br />Andrea and Barbara make a great team.  While we will be staying in our new home for some time, I will absolutely ask Andrea to represent us again and will be sending everyone I know who is buying or selling to her.</p>
